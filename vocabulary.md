# Vocabulary
Common vocabulary when working with GitHub and Git. For more vocabulary, see the [GitHub Glossary](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#branch)

* **Branch** - According to the Glossary, it is "a parallel version of a repository...but does not affect the primary or *master branch* allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version." One branch can be merged into another using a *pull request*.

* **Clone** - Creates a local (saved to machine) copy of a *project* (see Repository).
* **Commit** - Similar to saving an edit in a file. Commits have unique IDs that allow users or collaborators to see who changed a file, when they changed it, and what they changed. According to the Glossary, "Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made."
* **Fetch** - Once a repository is *cloned*, fetching is the process of copying over changes from the remote repository to your local one without merging the information.
* **Fork** - To copy of another user's repository. Forked repositories can be edited without affecting the original repository. Changes can be submitted to the original repository through use of a *pull request*.
* **Git** - A distributed *version control* system (DVCS).
* **Git Bash** - Microsoft Windows [application](https://gitforwindows.org/) that allows Windows users to utilize Git in the command line.
* **Git Large File Storage (LFS)** - An [extension](https://git-lfs.github.com/) that allows users to store references to large files in their *repository*.
* **gitignore** - A file (typically located in the root directory) that informs Git of which files or folders Git should ignore in a project.
* **Markdown** - A plain-text syntax that allows users to style text for the web. README files (like this one) are typically written in markdown. GitHub has its own version of markdown.
* **Master branch** - The primary branch in a repository.
* **Merge** - Takes the changes from one branch and combines them with another.
* **Pull request** - Asking the owner of a repository to *merge* two repository branches to combine edits. Collaborators are able to comment on and review the [potential changes](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
* **Push** - If a *clone* was created and then edited, you are able to push *commits* to the remote repository. Pushing essentially updates the remote repository (GitHub) with any commits that were made locally.
* **README** - A plain-text file and form of documentation that contains information about other files or software. Many open-source software pr projects contain a README, which oftentimes provides installation instructions, software specs, copyright, troubleshooting, or file information.
* **Repository** - The collection of files and folders (as well as their versions) associated with a specific project.
* **Root directory** - The top-most directory in a heirarchy. University of Waterloo created helpful [diagrams](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~dwharder/icsrts/Tutorials/Unix/directories/) to explain directory structures.
* **Version control** - The process by which different drafts (versions) of a recorded element are managed.
